# Build a LLM from Scratch

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and data used while following a practical, hands-on journey to build and experiment with language models (LLMs) from first principles.

## Summary

Contents include Jupyter notebooks, example training scripts, and data for small-scale experiments demonstrating tokenization, model training, and evaluation. The materials are educational and intended for learning and experimentation rather than production deployment.

## Repository structure

- `chapter2.ipynb`, `chapter3.ipynb`, `chapter4.ipynb`, `chapter5.ipynb`, `chapter6.ipynb`, `chapter7.ipynb` — Notebook chapters with explanations and runnable code.
- `chapter03.py`, `chapter04.py` — Example Python scripts extracted from chapters.
- `previous_chapters.py`, `previous_chapters1.py` — Helper/utility scripts.
- `train.csv`, `validation.csv`, `test.csv` — CSV datasets used in the examples.
- `sms_spam_collection/` — SMS spam dataset (TSV and README).
- `Images/` — Figures and saved HTML resources referenced by the notebooks.
- `requirements.txt` — Python packages required to run the notebooks and scripts.
- `accuracy-plot.pdf`, `loss-plot.pdf` — Example output plots generated by training runs.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open and run notebooks

Use Jupyter Lab / Notebook to step through the chapters:

```powershell
jupyter lab
```

Open the `chapter*.ipynb` files in the browser and run the cells in order.

## Running scripts

- Small example scripts such as `chapter03.py` and `chapter04.py` can be run directly after installing dependencies:

```powershell
python chapter03.py
python chapter04.py
```

Note: Some notebooks/scripts expect the dataset files (`train.csv`, `validation.csv`, `test.csv` or the `sms_spam_collection/` directory) to be present in the repository root.

## Reproducing plots

Notebooks generate `accuracy-plot.pdf` and `loss-plot.pdf` as part of training experiments. To reproduce these, open the corresponding chapter notebook and run the training cells (may take time depending on dataset and model size).

## Notes and assumptions

- These materials are for educational use. Models trained here are small and intended for demonstration.
- If you want to run larger experiments, adjust hardware (GPU) settings and batch sizes in the notebooks.

## Contributing

Suggestions, fixes, and improvements are welcome. Prefer small, focused pull requests that update notebooks, add tests, or improve documentation.

## License

This repository does not include a license file. If you intend to reuse or distribute code, consider adding a `LICENSE` file (for example MIT or Apache-2.0).
